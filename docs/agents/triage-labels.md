# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of canonical triage roles plus completion status. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                                      |

| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue                      |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information                     |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent                      |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation                                |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                                         |
| `done`                     | `done`               | Hoàn thành / Completed - issue has been implemented & verified |

## Applying labels in Local Markdown

- Record the label near the top of the issue file:
  `Status: <label>`
- When an agent or developer finishes implementing and verifying an issue according to its acceptance criteria, update the line to:
  `Status: done`
- When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding label string from the table above (`ready-for-agent`).
